The Directive generally restricts the transfer of personally identifiable information about individuals in the EU to the United States, unless there is \"adequate protection\" for such information when it is received in the United States. In addition to processing transactions for its own Merchants based in the United States, Chase Paymentech provides processing services in the U.S. for its European affiliate, Chase Paymentech Europe Limited, and its European customers. To address the restrictions in the Directive, Paymentech, LLC in the United States (\"CPL\") adheres to the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce (\"Safe Harbor\") with respect to Cardholder Data about Merchants' customers in the European Union that we receive in the United States (\"EU Cardholder Data\"). We act as a data processor on behalf of Merchants with respect to EU Cardholder Data, and accordingly follow each Merchants' instructions with regard to the collection, processing and protection of EU Cardholder Data. Our Merchants act as the data controller for any EU Cardholder Data. If any consumers in the EU have any questions about our handling of their EU Cardholder Data, such consumers should first contact the Merchant as this may be the most efficient means of addressing such issues. Consumers in the EU may also reach out to the CPL Safe Harbor Privacy Contact in the Legal Department at Chase Paymentech Solutions, 14221 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas, 75254. Questions that are not otherwise resolved with the Merchant and/or CPL may also be directed to local EU data protection authorities.", "label": ["International and Specific Audiences", "Other"]}
